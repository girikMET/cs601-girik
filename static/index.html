        <p>
            Trivy is an open-source, simple, and comprehensive vulnerability scanner for containers and other artifacts. It detects vulnerabilities in OS packages (Alpine, RHEL, CentOS, etc.) and application dependencies (Bundler, Composer, npm, yarn, etc.). Trivy is easy to use, requiring no prior knowledge or complex configuration, making it an ideal choice for those new to vulnerability scanning and experienced developers alike.
        </p>
        <p>
            As containerization gains popularity, the need for securing container images is becoming increasingly important. Containers can contain various vulnerabilities, including those in the base image, OS packages, and application dependencies. Identifying and addressing these vulnerabilities is critical to maintaining a secure application environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Trivy's key features include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wide range of supported languages and package managers</li>
            <li>Fast scanning, as Trivy only scans the diff between the layers in a container image</li>
            <li>High accuracy, as Trivy is able to recognize various types of vulnerabilities</li>
            <li>Simple and easy-to-understand output format, making it easy for developers to understand and act upon</li>
            <li>Integration with CI/CD pipelines, allowing vulnerability scans to be a part of the development process</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In this project, we utilize Trivy to perform on-demand vulnerability scanning of Docker images. By providing a simple interface for users to input a Docker image, our application leverages Trivy's capabilities to scan the image and display the results. This enables developers and system administrators to quickly and easily assess the security of their container images and make informed decisions about their deployment.
